# UNP_Project_MS_EXCEL_HR_DATA

Completed this project as a part of my Value Added Course with United Networks of Professionals (UNP).
In this project,I understoodthe task of transforming the vast dataset of HR ATTRITION DATA into a comprehensive and insightful Excel dashboard.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
1. The HR Attrition Dynamic Dashboard empowers HR Professionals and management to proactively address attrition challenges by providing real-time insights and actionable information.
2. By leveraging this tool, organisations can identify attrition patterns, focus retention efforts, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee engagement.
3. The dashboard provides a high level summary of attrition rates,including overall attrirition rate,voluntary vs involuntary attrition and attrition by department.
4. Interactive charts and graphs allow users to visualise attrition trends over time, enabling them to identify periods with high attrition or significant changes in attrition 
 rates.
